					<p>Hello, my name is Karan Grover. </p>
                   I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a focus on building reliable and large-scale distributed systems. Before coming to UW-Madison, I worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft Research for more than three years where I worked on a wide variety of projects like developing a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00602.pdf">cloud-native and secure ML Service</a> using IntelSGX in collaboration with Azure Confidential Computing, building a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/10/blockene-osdi20-5f97c46c0dae1.pdf">blockchain protocol</a> from scratch and developing a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-vishrambh/">project management solution</a> for one of India’s biggest Philanthropic Organization - Child Fund India. I learned how to build performant and scalable systems at MSR, and to strengthen my skills, I enrolled in the Master’s Program at UW-Madison. My courses focus on a mix of Systems and Machine Learning. Last Summer I interned at Meta(Facebook) as a part of their Inference Platform Team in the AI Infrastructure Group. My project was to develop an <a href="./docs/InternshipReport.pdf">A/B Testing Framework</a> for their new Inference Service. I was responsible for taking the project from design to production by working with different stakeholders to understand the engineering requirements and tradeoffs.
