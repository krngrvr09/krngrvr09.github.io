This page is somewhat inspired by Julia Evan's 'How I learned to program in 10 years' <a href = "https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/02/17/how-i-learned-to-program-in-10-years/"> blog post </a>. I want to document my programming journey here. I see programming as something I want to keep doing for a very long time, because it still excites me the same way it did when I started my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at IIIT-Delhi ~6 years ago.<br><br>

[May 2013] - Got done with my high school exams and decided I wanted to pursue Computer Science because I felt 'If I understand how computers work, I can literally make them do anything!'.<br><br>

[June 2013 - Aug 2013] - Took some introductory C classes at NIIT. I was pretty excited to see the computer printing the stuff I asked it to print. I was also proud to be able to make a command line marquee using a carefully structured loop with print and clear statements.<br><br>

[Aug 2013] - I start my undergraduate degree at IIIT-Delhi. I remember, going to all weekly research seminars for a month, losing the speaker in the first 10 minutes because well, I didnt know any thing about CS. Still, I was pretty excited about the scope of what I could learn. <br><br>

[Aug 2013 - Dec 2017] - Here I dont want to talk about the courses I took, the internships I did and the graded projects I worked on. I want to talk about my side-project. Because now that I knew about computers, "I could literally make them do anything!". So I worked on the following small side-projects in my free time.<br><br>
<ol>
<li><a href = "https://github.com/krngrvr09/Groovy-Lights"> Groovy Lights </a>: This turned out to be my most famous side project. In this project, I take an open source music player and connect the output of the bar that visualizes the music(which is basically a numerical value in a range) to the file that controls the brightness of the screen in Linux. That way, the brightness of the screen "dances" with the music. I posted a video on facebook and the next day, I had students coming in and shaking hands because they thought it was 'pretty dope'.
</li>
<br>
<li><a href = "https://github.com/krngrvr09/random-check"> Random-Check </a>: In this project, I visually check whether random functions used by a programming language are truly random. I randomly generate a bunch of 0s and 1s and plot them as a black/white pixel in an image. I have plotted the images for Python(seemed random) and PHP(not random at all).</li>
<br>

<li><a href = "https://github.com/krngrvr09/drum_machine"> Drum Machine </a>: In this project I make a basic drum machine using the WebAudio API.</li>
<br>

<li><a href = "https://github.com/krngrvr09/PhoneSilencer"> Phone Silencer </a>: In this project, I make an app that will automatically put my phone on silent mode once I enter the classroom. It does this by detecting the MAC address of the wifi router it is connected to.</li>
<br>

<li><a href = "https://github.com/krngrvr09/MobileTerminal"> Mobile Terminal </a>: In this project I try to see if I can make a 'mobile terminal'. Basically, I wanted to enter commands in my phone, run them on a cloud(Digital Ocean server) and report back the output. </li>
<br>

<li><a href = "https://github.com/krngrvr09/CourseSelection"> Course Selection </a>: This was the second most popular side project. I made a website that would allow students to select courses and instantly know if they have chosen conflicting timings. The usual way is for students to refer to the time table and determine this on their own.</li>
<br>

<li><a href = "https://github.com/krngrvr09/MouseDroid"> Mouse Droid </a>: In this project, I wanted to use the touch screen of my phone as a mouse track pad. My biggest learning from this project is I realized how important UDP is. I was sending date over sockets, and TCP is just too slow for this kind of streaming data.</li>
</ol>

[Jan 2018 - Aug 2019] - I worked at Microsoft Research to build a system that allows on to perform secure DNN Inference. I will only focus on the programming aspect here. I programmed a lot on C++ and Assembly. I learned how floating point numbers are handled by the CPU and how some CPU instructions work on vectorized registers to speed up the computation. I used this knowledge in my work to prevent a side channel attack on Intel SGX. I implemented around 10 Deep Neural Networks in C(using the Torch C Library) and a logistic regression in python.<br><br>

[Sept 2019 - Present] - I am working on a high throughput blockchain for mobile devices. I'll keep you updated on what I program here.<br><br>
